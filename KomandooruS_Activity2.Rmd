## Hobby ##

  Some of my hobbies are watching tv, movies, kdrama, listening to music, playing games, playing sports, exercising, enjoying new food, and enjoying life. I am currently watching kdrama which is really good, it's called [Today's Webtoon](https://dramacool.cr/drama-detail/today-s-webtoon). It has a combination of comedy, daily work life in a corporate setting, and comics.
